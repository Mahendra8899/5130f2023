In this week we have researched and collected data from the industry magzines and news sites and various blogs for our Leasing and Buying sections and imposed in a simple way in here and we have collected statistical data on leasing and buying car with help of survey reports.

Note: I have tried to host in weblabs but unfortunately the database connection not working so we hosted in AWS as the database is consuming and it is a pricing model if in case the login failed  it means the server is down and stopped for final submission. I will continue to open the server all the time .

And below are the my server link to access the page .
> http://18.217.155.159/
