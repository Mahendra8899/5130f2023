In this week we have added content in the details section with the special button to view that and also we make some changes in the calculator calculations to the updated car finances available in the market.
Compared to the most leading banks interest on car financing  , like DCU, Zolve, Chase.  

Note: I have tried to host in weblabs but unfortunately the database connection not working so we hosted in AWS as the database is consuming and it is a pricing model if in case the login failed  it means the server is down and stopped for final submission. I will continue to open the server all the time . And now the server is open for 3 days from today.

And below are the my server link to access the page .
> http://13.58.185.172/
