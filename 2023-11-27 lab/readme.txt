Please use google authenticator app to scan the qr and generate otp to sign in.

The data will be saved to userDatabase.json file .

1. npm install 
2. node app.js
include all files together

And I placed all the screenshots like working in mobile , working on desktop as well with authentication.

For temporary details you can use this:

Mail: newtest123@gmail.com
Password:admin123
Otp: I will keep on changing but can check in the console or use authenticator app.
